novi wishlist

- enable/disable, on a per-product basis, use of RPM epoch in sorting

- consider folding all of a given product's source RPMs into a single
  bucket.  Right now, two SRPMS for the same product can be put into
  different buckets, if they are of different architectures.  
  (Question: is it an invariant that all SRPMs are architecture-neutral?
   e.g. they are sometimes labeled w/ a given arch out of error, not
   intent?)

- make it faster (in the works)
