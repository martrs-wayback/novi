For this preview phase, novi's build process is still fairly raw.

Know the old "configure; make; make install" routine?  We have the first
two.  "make install" is due soon.

For the time being, you can copy the (lone) binary to your preferred
directory:

	build/bin/novi


I expect future releases to have a proper install routine.  RPMs are also
in the works.
