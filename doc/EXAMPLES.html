    novi sample usage

DESCRIPTION
    Sample scenarios for using novi

EXAMPLES
  Example: show the latest RPMs in a single directory
    You have a directory with the all of the RPMs for a given release. (That
    is, orignal RPMs plus the updates.) You want to see what's the latest
    version of each product therein.

       $ novi -a list /some/dir/RPMS

    The output isn't much to look at. That will change in the future. The
    "list" option started off as a debugging tool.

    Since "list" is the default action, you could shorten this commandline
    to:

       $ novi /some/dir/RPMS

    The program already looks for files of the pattern "*.rpm" so you don't
    have to specify this on the commandline.

    Note that the search for RPM files is NOT recursive; the files must
    exist just beneath the specified directory.

  Example: show the latest RPMs in a set of directories
    Your RPMs are separated into different directories -- OS, updates,
    third-party, and so on. You want to see the latest version of each
    product.

       $ novi /dir1/RPMS /dir2/RPMS /dir3/RPMS [...] /dirN/RPMS

    There's no hard limit on the number of RPMs novi can handle. The only
    limit should be your system's available memory for the objects, and any
    upper limits on your C++ implementation's STL containers.

  Example: hardlink the latest RPMs to another directory
    You want to find the latest-version RPMs in a series of directories, and
    hard-link them to another location (e.g. the base of a new Kickstart
    tree).

       $ novi -a hardlink -t /target/dir /dir1/RPMS [...] /dirN/RPMS

    As a reminder, the hard-link only works if all of these directories are
    on the same filesystem.

  Example: copy the latest RPMs to another directory
    This feature isn't yet implemented. Expect it in an upcoming release, if
    enough people really ask for it.

    Given the significant I/O activity, though, would you really want to
    copy the RPMs to the target directory? (A single Fedora release can have
    a couple of gigabytes in RPMs.) By comparison, a hard-link isn't quite
    so I/O-intensive: it just requires another file pointer in the inode
    table, which doesn't require reading/writing the file itself.
