resolved in version 2.1.1 (2012/07/29)

- removed default file perms in the spec file.  This caused 
  problems under RHEL6 and CentOS 6


resolved in version 2.1.0 (2010/01/12)

- for "repo:" style repo paths, now reads repodata/repomd.xml
  to find primary file (instead of looking for "primary.xml.gz")


resolved in version 2.0.1 (2008/12/29)

- fixed handling of epoch in file loads


resolved in version 2.0.0 (2008/12/28)

- updated to work with RPM 4.6, which ships with Fedora 10

- shuffled directory structure to prep for future work


resolved in version 1.1.9 (2008/06/29):

- modified some #include statements to address GCC 4.3 changes

  (as first noticed in Fedora 9)

  (please see http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/porting_to.html 
   for details)

- removed some packages from the spec file's BuildRequires
  section -- some of these packages no longer exist in Fedora 9


resolved in version 1.1.8 (2008/02/08):

- misc internal tweaks

- added '--version' commandline switch to show product version


resolved in version 1.1.7 (2007/09/01):

- added some macro magic to detect newer versions of Expat,
  which use an enum instead of plain XML_STATUS_OK


resolved in version 1.1.6 (2006/05/14):

- corrected a header #include<> problem that older compilers
  (understandably) didn't handle well.  This should fix the
  build problems on CentOS3, among others...


resolved in version 1.1.5 (2006/05/14):

- novi now handles source RPMS.  This helps cases in which your
  favorite RPM repository doesn't supply binary packages for your
  platform, so you must build from source.

- tweaked format of "list" output


resolved in version 1.1.4 (2006/05/07):

- corrected thinko in epoch handling

resolved in version 1.1.3 (2006/05/06):

- now uses RPM epoch for sort calcs.
  Note that this will cause problems for packages that
  misuse epoch (e.g. apply an older epoch to a newer release);
  a workaround is in progress.

resolved in version 1.1.2 (2005/10/01):

- purely a cleanup release: migrated classes into separate
  files to simplify maintenance

resolved in version 1.1.1 (not released):

- added some missing libs in the Makefile's link section. I'm
  not sure how this slipped past... perhaps libtool compensated
  for my error.


resolved in version 1.1.0 (2005/07/18):

- added a new way to load data: it uses a Yum repo data file, 
  which already has the header information from the RPMs.
  In turn, this trims novi processing time because it gets to 
  skim a single XML file instead of loading hundreds of RPMs.

resolved in version 1.0.1:

- fixed (lack of) error handling in RPM parsing:
	1/ Neglected to check for "not found" code; was
	   only checking for "error" code
	2/ Neglected to check whether file was readable
	   before passing it to RPM

- removed some extraneous extern defs that caused the build to
  fail under GCC 4 (FC4)

- added extra BuildRequires defs to the spec file, to catch missing
  build prereqs early

(no change log kept prior to version 1.0.1; those were all preview releases)
